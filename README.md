- working with Axios to fetch data from other servers
- Working with 3rd party API's; in this case https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
2. Materual-UI
- The fact that you can intertwine the construction of components with JS 
- Reading through documentation to work through issues
- working with libraries prior to the latest release
3. AWS S3 hosting
